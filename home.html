              <h2>What Is Bitcoin?</h2>
              <p>
                Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a virtual currency designed to act
                as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one
                person, group, or entity, and thus removing the need for
                third-party involvement in financial transactions.

              <h2>What Is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
              <p>
                A cryptocurrency is a digital, encrypted, and decentralized
                medium of exchange. Unlike the U.S. Dollar or the Euro, there is
                no central authority that manages and maintains the value of a
                cryptocurrency.
